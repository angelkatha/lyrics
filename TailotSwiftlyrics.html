He said, "Let's get out of this town,</br>
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."</br>
I thought heaven can't help me now.</br>
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down</br>
</br>
He's so tall and handsome as hell</br>
He's so bad but he does it so well</br>
I can see the end as it begins</br>
My one condition is</br>
</br>
Say you'll remember me</br>
Standing in a nice dress,</br>
Staring at the sunset, babe</br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks</br>
Say you'll see me again</br>
Even if it's just in your</br>
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,</br>
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.</br>
</br>
I said, "No one has to know what we do, "</br>
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room</br>
And his voice is a familiar sound,</br>
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now</br>
</br>
He's so tall and handsome as hell</br>
He's so bad but he does it so well</br>
And when we've had our very last kiss</br>
My last request it is</br>
</br>
Say you'll remember me</br>
Standing in a nice dress,</br>
Staring at the sunset, babe</br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks</br>
Say you'll see me again</br>
Even if it's just in your</br>
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,</br>
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.</br>
</br>
You see me in hindsight</br>
Tangled up with you all night</br>
Burning it down</br>
Someday when you leave me</br>
I bet these memories</br>
Follow you around</br>
</br>
You'll see me in hindsight</br>

Even if it's just pretend</br>
</br>
Say you'll remember me</br>
Standing in a nice dress,</br>
Staring at the sunset, babe</br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks</br>
Say you'll see me again</br>
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)</br>
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh</br>
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh</br>
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha</br>
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.</br>
