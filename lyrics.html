O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,<br>
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight<br>
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?<br>
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br>
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,<br>
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br>
O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light<br>
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight<br>
O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?<br>
And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br>
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,<br>
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br>
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,<br>
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion<br>
A home and a Country should leave us no more?<br>
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.<br>
No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br>
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,<br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br>
O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand<br>
Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!<br>
Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land<br>
Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!<br>
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,<br>
And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,” <br>
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br>
